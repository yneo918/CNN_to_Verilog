Pipeline analysis report

1. Report Description and Glossary
----------------------------------

Description:
This report shows a "what-if" analysis of potential Fmax increase as a result of
hypothetically inserting pipeline stages in the design's feed-forward paths. The
entry for Added Latency of 0 reflects the current design performance with no
pipeline stages added.

The -report_loops option shows the slowest path within a sequential feedback loop.
Sequential loops cannot be pipelined. These are paths starting from and ending at
the same sequential cell, and may have zero, one, or more sequential cells in the
feedback path.

Glossary:
Clock : The timing clock of the paths being analyzed for performance increase through pipelining
Added Latency : Number of added pipeline stages
Ideal Fmax : The current Fmax
Ideal Delay : The current minimum clock period
Requirement : The required maximum delay based on the timing constraints
WNS : Requirement minus delay
Added Pipe Reg : Maximum number of pipeline registers to add to the design for the given Added Latency
Total Pipe Reg : Total number of pipeline registers to add to the clock group for the given Added Latency
Pipeline Insertion Startpoint : Cell startpoint of path with longest delay
Pipeline Insertion Endpoint : Cell endpoint of path with longest delay
